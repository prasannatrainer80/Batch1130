Spring Boot Integration with Angular 

IN Spring Boot first implemented one mini project kind of Swiggy related. 

It contains various modules as


1) Customer
2) Menu
3) Wallet
4) Vendor
5) Orders



Spring MVC 
____________

In traditional applications, we have 3 layers 

User Services  Business Services Data Services


In this above scenario changes in one layer will have huge impact on another layer. 

So, if you want to make any application as 

loosely coupled and tightly integrated 

w.r.t. TDD environment (Test Driven Development)

Then the best model is MVC 

Model -> Contains core business logic. 

View -> It is a standard ui page... which contains user input, error pages, result pages...

Controller -> It acts as a glue between model and view.  As it contains basic action name, based on action name controller will be mapped or redirected to corresponding target page.

To achieve this in MVC, we have various annotation 

@Controller, 

any class that which is having annotation as @Controller used to write any action redirection code to that. 

@MvcConfiguration : this file contains all the configuration information about the particular project, as where to palce view files and any dependencies to be injected. 

You can specify mapping for the particular action by using @GetMapping or @RequestMapping 

@GetMapping("/")  => It acts as a default mapping to be redirected. 

@GetMapping("/login") -> in this method to which page we need to redirect in that we have to specify.

Running of the MVC Application :
________________________________

1) Once you run any MVC application, first it checks all the configuration info from @MvcConfiguration file and then it redirects to the default mapping file. 

This job internally specified by component called FrontController 

2) Then once you click on any url, then the from controller checks for respective controller w.r.t. component specified 

after that it would be redirected to the target page. 


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Angular is all about components, as any kind of business logic to be implemented, we need to specify in components only. 

As once you create any angular project first by default app component will be created. If you want to create any own components then we need 

ng g c component_name 

Once the command executes, it creates 4 files as 

component.ts
component.html
component.spec.ts
component.css

the component.ts file is heart, where it has

@Component declaration and contains 
tag as selector as

selector='app-first'

Then after the writing business logic in this, write relevant code in HTML also, then 

to run this code, first step copy the selector 

and this select to be added to target component in HTML format.

<app-first> </app-first>
