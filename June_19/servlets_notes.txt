Servlet Filter
Filter
Usage of Filter
Advantage of Filter
Filter API
Filter interface
FilterChain interface
FilterConfig interface
Simple Example of Filter
A filter is an object that is invoked at the preprocessing and postprocessing of a request.

It is mainly used to perform filtering tasks such as conversion, logging, compression, encryption and decryption, input validation etc.

The servlet filter is pluggable, i.e. its entry is defined in the web.xml file, if we remove the entry of filter from the web.xml file, filter will be removed automatically and we don't need to change the servlet.

So maintenance cost will be less.


Filter Syntax

The object of FilterChain is responsible to invoke the next filter or resource in the chain.This object is passed in the doFilter method of Filter interface.The FilterChain interface contains only one method:

public void doFilter(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response): it passes the control to the next filter or resource.

ServletConfig Interface
ServletConfig Interface
Methods of ServletConfig interface
How to get the object of ServletConfig
Syntax to provide the initialization parameter for a servlet
Example of ServletConfig to get initialization parameter
Example of ServletConfig to get all the initialization parameter
An object of ServletConfig is created by the web container for each servlet. This object can be used to get configuration information from web.xml file.

If the configuration information is modified from the web.xml file, we don't need to change the servlet. So it is easier to manage the web application if any specific content is modified from time to time.

syntax :

ServletConfig config=getServletConfig();  

_____________________________________________________________________________

ServletContext Interface
ServletContext Interface
Usage of ServletContext Interface
Methods of ServletContext interface
How to get the object of ServletContext
Syntax to provide the initialization parameter in Context scope
Example of ServletContext to get initialization parameter
Example of ServletContext to get all the initialization parameter
An object of ServletContext is created by the web container at time of deploying the project. This object can be used to get configuration information from web.xml file. There is only one ServletContext object per web application.

If any information is shared to many servlet, it is better to provide it from the web.xml file using the <context-param> element.

Syntax of getServletContext() method
public ServletContext getServletContext()  
Example of getServletContext() method
//We can get the ServletContext object from ServletConfig object  
ServletContext application=getServletConfig().getServletContext();  
  
//Another convenient way to get the ServletContext object  
ServletContext application=getServletContext();

Cookie class
javax.servlet.http.Cookie class provides the functionality of using cookies. It provides a lot of useful methods for cookies.

Constructor of Cookie class
Constructor	Description
Cookie()	constructs a cookie.
Cookie(String name, String value)	constructs a cookie with a specified name and value.
Useful Methods of Cookie class
There are given some commonly used methods of the Cookie class.

Method	Description
public void setMaxAge(int expiry)	Sets the maximum age of the cookie in seconds.
public String getName()	Returns the name of the cookie. The name cannot be changed after creation.
public String getValue()	Returns the value of the cookie.
public void setName(String name)	changes the name of the cookie.
public void setValue(String value)	changes the value of the cookie.
Other methods required for using Cookies
For adding cookie or getting the value from the cookie, we need some methods provided by other interfaces. They are:
public void addCookie(Cookie ck):method of HttpServletResponse interface is used to add cookie in response object.
public Cookie[] getCookies():method of HttpServletRequest interface is used to return all the cookies from the browser.
How to create Cookie?
Let's see the simple code to create cookie.

Cookie ck=new Cookie("user","sonoo jaiswal");//creating cookie object  
response.addCookie(ck);//adding cookie in the response  
How to delete Cookie?
Let's see the simple code to delete cookie. It is mainly used to logout or signout the user.

Cookie ck=new Cookie("user","");//deleting value of cookie  
ck.setMaxAge(0);//changing the maximum age to 0 seconds  
response.addCookie(ck);//adding cookie in the response  
How to get Cookies?
Let's see the simple code to get all the cookies.

Cookie ck[]=request.getCookies();  
for(int i=0;i<ck.length;i++){  
 out.print("<br>"+ck[i].getName()+" "+ck[i].getValue());//printing name and value of cookie  
}
