JSP (Java Server Pages) 

What is the main drawback in servlets ???

Servlets contains 2 files as HTML file for static content and servlet for dynamic content. 

Changes in one file will have huge impact on another file. 

Everytime, we need to restart the server to get the updates. 

Then there is problem as the combination of both static and dynamic content to be placed in same file
will improve the performance of the application. 

Example : If i want to load all employee names n dropdown, as html don't contains any server side code, 
as its tedious to do in servlets. 

So, this kind of problem we need to overcome, then we need the help of jsp. 

Jsp file after compilation it generates servlet. 

Jsp File have all capabilities that servlet will do like instance persistenance, session management, 
redirecting page, cookies, querystring etc...

The advantage is JSP file contains both java code and html code together. 

Please apply routing for yesterday 2 components and show me

<%-- Welcome to JSP --%>

For comments we need to use as <%-- --%>

In between whatever you type can be treated as comment. 

Declarations : As you need to declare any variables or create an object etc...

<%! %>

This tag used to for declarations as

<%!
   int a;
   double b;
   String str;
%>

Imports : Used to add existing classes or system directives. 

<%@ import %>

example : 

<%@ import java.util.List %>

How to write actual JSP code 

<%

%>

The above tags are known as scriptlets, means any kind of java code to be written in scriplets only. 

<%
   a= 5;
   b = 7;
   c = a+b;
   d = (9%c)/5+32;
%>

Expressions : Means any existing values to be printed, then we need expression tags as

<%= %>

Example : 

<%
   Date obj = new Date();
%>

Time : 

<%=obj.getHours() %> : <%=obj.getMinutes() %> : <%=obj.getSeconds() %>

@Override
public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
...
...
}

In Jsp, we have intrisic objects 

request	-> Contains all information about the request page

response -> Contains global information about the response specific data.

application  -> APplication oriented data to be stored

session	-> During multiple requests need to maintain request specific data

out -> Used to print any value on the web page.
